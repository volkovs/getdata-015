### Data source

Original data set was downloaded from [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip). A full description of the data set can be retrieved from [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

### Data transformations

**There is only a brief description of the transformations applied. For detailed specification please read "run_analysis.R"**.

- train and test data sets were united
- activity, subject and sensor data sets were column-bounded
- data set names were taken from "*features.txt*"
- mean and standard deviation variables were projected
- activity labels were taken from "*activity_labels.txt*"
- all numeric variables were aggregated by activity and subject; *mean* function applied
- result data set is written into "*tidy_data_set.txt*"
